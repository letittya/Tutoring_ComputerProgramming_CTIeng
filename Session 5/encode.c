/*
Implement a function void encodeString(char *s, char buff[], int cap) which builds into buff, 
the string having all the sub-strings of identical letters (as given by isalpha) replaced with 
a group consisting of the corresponding letter and the number of occurrences in the original string. 
Leave other characters unchanged. Avoid overflowing.

I.e.: encodeString("giiGGGEELLLA") should put into buff: "giG2E3L3A"
