/*
Implement a function that receives an array of integers and its capacity and fills the 
array with all the values read from the keyboard which are prime numbers, without overflowing 
the array. The keyboard input might consist of other data (words) that are to be ignored. Return 
the numbers of elements copied into the array. Also, provide an adequate main() function.
