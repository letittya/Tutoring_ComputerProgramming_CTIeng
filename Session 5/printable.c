/*
Implement a function that receives an array of uint8_t, together with its number of elements, 
another array of characters together with its capacity and builds into the second array a "sentence" 
consisting of the words made of the printable characters (as given by isprint()), separated by spaces 
associated to the non-printable chars from the initial array (a sequence of non-printable characters is 
going to be replaced with a single space).
