/*
Implement a function char *reverseVowel(char *s) which takes a string consisting of words, separated by at 
least one space (excepting the first and last word) and returns another string where each of the words 
starting with vowel are reversed, leaving the other words unchanged. Keep the same amount of spaces between words.

I.e.: "Anthony has a lot of apples and oranges" should yield into "yngotnA has a lot fo selppa dna segnaro"
